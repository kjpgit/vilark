# ViLark Changelog

## 2023.9.12 (Version 1.6.1)
* Fix flickering on some terminals

  only the parent process will restore to the "main screen" upon exit.

## 2023.9.11 (Version 1.6)
* Don't follow directory symlinks, because it often causes infinite loops

## 2023.9.10 (Version 1.5)
* "Zero-Lag" Fast switch ability, using HTTP listener socket to respond to a file
  selection request from the vim plugin.  It means you only load a large
