# ViLark Tutorial 3

Congratulations, you now have two files open in vim!

The first was selected from the shell, and the second
was selected from inside of vim.

But now we want to get back to our first file.

Press \<spacebar\>, then press 'b'.  This will launch vilark again,
but instead of looking for new files, it will list our current buffers.

Type 'tut 2' and press Up/Down/Tab until you are over tutorial 2 (again).

Press \<Enter\> to have vim go back to that buffer, and congratulations, that
is the end of the beginner tutorial!
