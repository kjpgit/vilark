# ViLark Tutorial 2

Congratulations, you have completed the first tutorial!

You started `vilark` from the shell, and then vilark launched vim.

Now that we are in vim, we want to work on a few more files.

Press \<spacebar\>, then press 'e'.  This will launch vilark again,
but this time vim is launching it, not the shell.

Type '3' and press Up/Down/Tab until you are over tutorial 3.

Press \<Enter\> to open it in this existing vim process.
