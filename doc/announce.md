# ViLark: A fast, beautiful file explorer and buffer selector for Vim

I am pleased to announce the public release of ViLark, an open-source,
native-compiled file selector plugin for Vim and bash.

It's already an indispensable part of my workflow, and I plan on using
and maintaining the plugin for many years.

It's written in C#, believe it or not, and runs on Linux.  Mac OS is hopefully
upcoming.

It's similar to fzf, but the UX, search algorithm, and design objectives are
completely new and focused on vim.
