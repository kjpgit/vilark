# Why Vilark?

Vilark is designed to bring more joy to using Vim.

In particular, finding files to edit, and finding buffers to switch to,
has always been a painful, ugly part of using Vim for me.

Vilark is designed to be easier to use, more intuitive, and faster than the
stock Vim "UX", when searching for files and buffers.  The configuration doesn't
require inscrutable, clunky syntax.

Vilark is also designed to be maintainable and bug free, using a proven language
like C#, while still compiling to native code.
